Before diving into the mission of interpreting data and constructing a story out of it, Rick (my team-mate) and I had to find a topic which will be in our field of interest, and one which we both can analyze with the knowledge and analytical tools we have. Since Rick and I have different backgrounds both in the field of knowledge and the analytical training, it took us several rounds until we found the topic for this assignment. 	This process illuminated the mechanisms which are involved in designing our understanding of the daily social political and economic events. It enabled me to see where sources of obstacles in comprehending a specific matter, gaps in interpreting information and diversity in concluding can be found. It is all in the “voids” which exist between fragments of data, facts. 
	After some discussion, we decided to work on the death of Scott Weiland, the singer for Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver. One of the reasons that made us choose this topic is that the death of a person usually gives voice to different opinions about this person’s life habits, sayings, and other issues that this person’s death comes across. Rick took a snap shot of the data (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bq1vsotbjCLwsHX0TEIH5fS-_oV0j_QRD0abHiSkvQ0/edit?usp=sharing) and a quick glance on the Twitter’s data from the day Scott Weiland died revealed that indeed people raised questions about the cause of his death and several speculations were suggested. References to provocative statements he made a few days ago could be found as well. So, I was ready to go deeper in my investigation of the story.
	The first thing I noticed and that made me wonder were tweets that mentioned ISIS. I couldn’t understand how ISIS related to Scott Weiland death. One tweet by @GoodOlPal even went so far to argue that “Isis got to Scott Weiland... What can be done about this?” Another surprising tweet by a user named @wowcoolstory expressed the same spirit “Smdh isis takes another life. Damn they work quick.“ So, I was very confused, why would ISIS want to hurt Scott Weiland? 
  I “went back in time” and read the first tweets on our data time-frame (starting on Thursday Dec 3ird at 00:02:07) I found many references to Scott Weiland provocative statements about ISIS as well as about Donald Trump. I kept looking and reading the tweets and thanks to links people included in their tweets I eventually found a recording of the radio-show during which Scott Weiland said “F- ISIS” and called Trump’s residency “Nightmare” (http://ultimateclassicrock.com/scott-weiland-isis/?trackback=twitter_top_flat_3 ). However, while the insult of Trump disappeared from Twitter after Weiland’s death, ISIS kept being mentioned, while it is obvious that they had nothing to do with Weiland’s death. I assume that some people connected ISIS to Weiland’s death just to be amusing. However, it can be understood by the fact that ISIS is a terror organization and people who blamed them for Weiland’s death did so, on some deep psychological level, in order to continue his “heritage” and fix ISIS as the ultimate enemy with zero tolerance toward them.
  Another interesting topic that is mentioned in the tweets is drugs. 89 tweets mentioned, directly and indirectly, that Weiland used to do drugs and this is the cause for his death (which sounds much more logical to me than the ISIS speculations :-). However, surprisingly no one wrote cynically about his drug abuse and blamed Weiland for his own death. No one wrote something like it was clear that this is what’s waiting for him, or that he deserves it. For example: @ X0MBY  wrote: “Holy fucking shit! Wow..... Rest In Power, Scott Weiland. 😟 Don't do drugs kids”. The comments were really respectful and sad. It made me realize how people loved him.
  So after mapping the topics and swing tweets together to understand who Scott Weiland really was and what was his cultural place and importance, I wanted to see how the information about his death spread out, so I looked for the first tweet which mentions his death. @LongPaulLA was the first user to mention Weiland’s death: “Former STP front man Scott Weiland found dead! https://t.co/LWoBX2AOLq”. Following the tweets one can see that there are many people who refused to believe that this is true. Here are some examples: @RedJakiBlue wrote: “God gives you the Wiz but taketh the Scott Weiland. I am devastated at this loss if it's true”. @Haunt1013 wrote: “Is it true Scott Weiland has passed away? 😭”, and @dmbmonkey41 wrote:” No, not Scott Weiland! Really hope this isn't true. I loved STP”. I was amazed to see how people react to “News” like it is about a close friend. I think that through twitter we can see how the digital world made people feel closer to each other and react as a community, even though people have no idea who are the readers of their tweets. It is SUPER interesting.
  One of the most interesting things that I noticed was that, although there weren’t many “conversations” ( i.e. people just stated what they think and didn’t reacted to others’ tweets), many (2380!!) people re-tweeted @DaveNavarro tweet: “Just learned our friend Scott Weiland has died. So gutted, I am thinking of his family tonight”. Navarro, a rock guitarist himself, tweeted only once, but apparently the fact that he has so many followers made his tweet the most significant tweet in our data sheet. He has 282395 followers. However, when I looked on his “status-url” http://twitter.com/DaveNavarro/statuses/672641902185811968,looking for the original massage I found that this massage has been removed…. I was wondering why he did it, but couldn’t find an answer. In addition, it is not clear to me why people prefer to re-tweet instead of writing their own tweet. But maybe I fail to understand the meaning of re-tweet since I’m new to this media of Twitter…   
  Last thing I think worth mentioning is the language variety. I was amazed to see that there are tweets in more than 12 languages! Obviously the leading language is English (7753 out of 8496) but there were many tweets in Spanish (~600) and other languages. It makes me think about the ability to communicate and to create new forms of communities. I think Twitter and other networks enables new structures of communities, but one should always be aware of the power relations even in language, which language is accessible to whom and who has the power to voice their opinions.
